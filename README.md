## Scenario Description:

The goal of this project is to design and build a relational database that models the operations of an online retail company. The main focus of the database is the Customer, who browses products, adds them to their cart, and places orders. The database also includes entities like Product, Category, Cart, Order, Payment, Shipper, and Address, which help track different parts of the shopping process from start to finish. The purpose of this project is to organize and connect these entities in a way that accurately reflects how an online store works in real life. After creating the data model, we generated sample data and populated each table to represent real business activity. Finally, we will run SQL queries on the data to answer business-like questions.

## Data Model:

## Data Dictionary

## Ten Queries:

## Database Information
